# Project Description

Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following:

- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.
  Existing cryptocurrency wallets require a certain threshold for use and are difficult to promote on a large scale. 
  Users need to use a series of complex addresses to transfer money, which is far from the experience of traditional centralized applications.

- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.
  We use encryption algorithms to realize the transfer of mobile phone numbers and email addresses while ensuring the security of the wallet. Innovatively break through the barriers between centralized identity and district centralized asset transactions.

## Value

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:

- What are the benefits to getting this right?
  It can greatly reduce the threshold for the use of digital currency wallets, and attract more digital currency investors and users interested in digital currency to use more secure decentralized wallets. At the same time, it innovatively breaks through the barriers between centralized identity and regional centralized assets.

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
  The threshold of existing decentralized wallets is too high, and novice users of digital currency are more inclined to use some centralized exchanges and wallets, which will expose their cryptocurrency assets to huge risks. At the same time, the existing The user experience of decentralized wallets is poor, and users are likely to lose or transfer the wrong cryptocurrency assets.

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?
  We need sufficient funds to recruit the team for development.

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

The project will include the generation, import and transfer of multiple cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Filecoin. The product uses the BIP-44 protocol to generate HD wallets, and can easily manage multiple cryptocurrencies with only one mnemonic. Assets. The most important feature of this product is the ability to transfer money using mobile phone numbers and email addresses. Since then, there is no need to remember a complicated wallet address. You only need to know a person's contact information to transfer money to it.

## Development Roadmap

milestone 1
Wallet prototype design, technology selection, scheme confirmation, prototype realization. Need 3 people, 1 month to complete. This stage requires approximately $10,000 in funding.

milestone 2
The wallet interface is developed to realize basic functions such as wallet import, export, and transfer. At the same time, it realizes the unified mnemonic phrase to generate the wallet, and finally realizes the centralized identity of the district, using mobile phone number and e-mail to transfer money. This stage is developed by 3 people, takes about 2 months, and requires $10,000 in funding.

milestone 3
Improve the wallet function and use encryption algorithms to achieve anonymous transaction functions. Transaction records between addresses cannot be queried on the blockchain, thus ensuring the anonymity and privacy of user transactions. This stage requires 3 people to develop and it takes 2 months Time, it needs 10,000 US dollars of funds.

## Total Budget Requested

In the entire project development process, a total of 30,000 US dollars is required to pay the salaries of team members, a designer, a back-end developer, and a front-end developer.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Our long-term goal is to attract some users who have never used a decentralized cryptocurrency asset wallet before and provide them with a more convenient and efficient cryptocurrency asset wallet experience.
